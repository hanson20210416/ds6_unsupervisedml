All explanations and comments are in the Jupyter notebook. 

for the cluster_words assignment:

I made a cluster_words.py as a module. I imported some functions into my notebook.
There are two classes files. I made them for parameter tuning. If I have more time, it is better to import the two classes to finish all steps (Vectoriver, Model_selection, Visualization, Evaluation, no need the cluster_words.py file.)
